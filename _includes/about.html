                <p>Born in Busan, and residing in Chicago, I am a proud Korean American. If I were to choose 3 words to describe my mind, it would be: nerdy, creative, and passionate. If I were to choose 3 fields of interest, it would be: <b>technology</b>, <b>filmmaking</b>, and <b>philosophy</b>.</p>

                <p>The purpose of this website is to showcase and store my interests in one aggregated location. In the explore section below, there will be 3 separate parts for each of my interests: technology, filmmaking, and philosophy. Of course, this website itself is a showcase for the technology part.</p>

                <p>Hope you enjoy exploring my projects!</p>
