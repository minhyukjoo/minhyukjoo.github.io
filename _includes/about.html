                <p>My name is Joo Minhyuk, or <b>Matt</b> if that's easier. Born in Busan, and residing in Chicago, I am a proud <b>Korean American</b>. If I were to choose 3 words to describe my mind, it would be: nerdy, creative, and unfathomable. If I were to choose 3 attitudes towards life, it would be: eager, vigorous, and relentless. If I were to choose 3 passions, it would be: <b>technology</b>, <b>filmmaking</b>, and <b>philosophy</b>.</p>

                <p>The purpose of this website is to <b>showcase</b> and store my passions in one aggregated location. In the sections below, there will be 3 separate parts for each of my passions: technology, filmmaking, and philosophy. You can either <b>scroll down</b>, or use the <b>navigation menu</b> on the top right of the page. The goal is to keep this page updated with all of my past and upcoming projects. Please come back from time to time!</p>

                <p>Hope you enjoy exploring my <b>projects</b>.</p>
