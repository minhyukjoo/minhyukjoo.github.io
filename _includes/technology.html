                    <p>I cannot give you a solid reason or cause as to why I pursued a tech career amongst all of my other interests. But certainly one major reason was because I did not know anything about it. Up until my first Java class in college, I did not understand what coding even was. For all one knows I might just enjoy the state of not knowing. Right now, I am a tech consultant at Accenture, working as a software developer in my current project. </p>
                    
                    <p>For obvious reasons, I cannot showcase my actual professional work due to NDAs, but here are some of my old school projects! (also this website is an example of a tech project)</p>

                    <p><b>Munchie Buddies (App Mockup Project)</b></p>
                    <p>Munchie Buddies is an app that splits food delivery fees with people around you. It is a real-time location-based group deal for food delivery. This was one of the projects I worked on in my senior year in College, Illinois Institute of Technology, and it was for IT Entreprenuership course.</p>
