                    <p>As a fiercely <b>curious</b> individual, I never ceased to <b>question</b>. But one can only dwell in the sea of unknowns for so long until discovering a <b>revelation</b>. Though that revelation is hard to translate in words efficiently, I have formed concrete ways to view <b>tangible</b> topics in our <b>reality</b>. Here are some of my attempts to express that.</p>

                    <p id="vidtext">I don't know about you, but my experience with Uber (and other ride-sharing services) has been of cultural exploration. Vast majority of the drivers I get are from different cultures and backgrounds. The amount of first-hand perspectives I gained from simply talking and connecting with themn is priceless! Learn your fellow humans.</p>

                    <span id="vidtitle"><b>The Root of Racism</b></span>
                    <p id="vidtext2">Many might dismiss racism as human nature, but the history of racism only spans centuries. There are no historical records, nor evidence found for the proof that racism existed in other cultures than the west before the modern era. But you don’t need historical evidence to prove that the root of racism stems from western individualism.</p>
                    <p id="vidtext">This writing will mainly focus on American racism, specifically the racism against African Americans, and dissecting the cultural DNA. This writing will identify the root cause of racism, and also the solution. But even if we assume that the solution is humanly possible, should racism be solved? And at what cost?</p>

                    <p id="vidtext2"><b>Coming (Not So) Soon!</b> This is going to be more of a book in terms of length.</p>
                    <p id="vidtext2">Extreme-polar-ends terms like everything, nothing, good, bad, etc are a fundamental logical makeup of the universe. But the more depth in reason you dig into, the more similar these two polar ends become. For example, if I were to call everyone I know as my best friends, are there any best friends left? Best friend by definition necessarily needs a non-best friend to exist. If everyone is my best friend, no one is.</p>
                    <p id="vidtext">Just like that, there is a line of logic you can follow to reach a perspective where each polar ends meet at the same spot. With that perspective, you can make conclusions about the world, including the very definition of what humanity means, how it began, where it’s going, and how it would eventually come to an end. And how that beginning will be its own ending, just like how Zero O’Clock is the 12 O’Clock.</p>

                    <p>Philosophy isn’t a <b>hobby</b> you can easily express to people around you. But I am so <b>passionate</b> about it so I started <b>writing</b> it down, which seems like the only thing I can think of to <b>actualize</b> my passion for it. I was born atheist, but became Christian, ironically through <b>secular philosophy</b>.</p>
                    <p>Since when I was in middle school, it always bothered me that in history classes, a <b>hero</b> to one nation was a <b>villain</b> to another. I felt the need to discover an <b>objective</b> way to view the world. What was meant to be a <b>search</b> for objective <b>morality</b> led to topics of history, culture, linguistics, anthropology, and philosophy. By the end of my high school years, I had fully developed my own mixture of <b>stoicism</b>, <b>relativism</b>, <b>daoism</b> and <b>existentialism</b> without even knowing the definitions of these words nor the philosophers behind it. I knew that I had reached the end of secular reasoning with it, but I was severely <b>disappointed</b>. Because I found out that, in secular thought, what is the most objective is to be completely <b>subjective</b>.</p>
                    <p>My disappointment led to more <b>reasoning</b>, yearning for <b>objectivity</b>. After researching all of the major <b>religions</b> and philosophies, both alive and dead, I landed on <b>Christianity</b>. I never looked back ever since. I am a “secular-existentialist-turned-Christian-apologist”, objectively <b>defending</b> my Christian <b>faith</b> in the most secular way. If you want to discuss any of these topics, please reach out to me via the links found in the ‘Connect’ section on the bottom of the page. Don't hesitate because I literally live for these <b>discussions</b>!</p>
