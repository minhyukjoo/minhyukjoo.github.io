                    <p><b>Study Abroad to China in 2018</b></p>
                    <p>I was thankfully able to seek multiple study abroad opportunities in my time in college: once to Germany and another to China. I have purposefully chosen nations that did not speak the language I spoke, but also had a significant cultural, economic, political impact in the region. The goal was to confirm if my knowledge and perspective on these regions were accurate, and to find my own bias tendencies. This video is but a short highlights of my trip to China. Hope you enjoy!</p>
