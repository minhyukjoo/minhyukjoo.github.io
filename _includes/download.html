                    <p>In my view, filmmaking is the greatest medium to express my <b>creativity</b>. I started off with video editing back when I couldn't afford a good camera. These days I am also getting into photography as well, which you can check out in my <b>photography</b> IG page in the 'Connect' section on the bottom of the page. For now, here are some of my video projects.</p>

                    <p id="vidtext">I was thankfully able to seek multiple study abroad opportunities in my time in college: once to Germany and another to China. I have purposefully chosen nations that did not speak the language I spoke, but also had a significant cultural, economic, political impact in the region. The goal was to confirm if my knowledge and perspective on these regions were accurate, and to find my own bias tendencies. This video is but a short highlights of my trip to China. Hope you enjoy!</p>
